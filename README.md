**What is a port scanner?** 

A port scanner is a computer program that checks network ports for one of three possible statuses â€“ open, closed, or filtered. Port scanners are valuable tools in diagnosing network and connectivity issues. However, attackers use port scanners to detect possible access points for infiltration and identify what kinds of devices you are running on the network, like firewalls, proxy servers, or VPN servers. 

**How does a port scanner work?**

A port scanner sends a network request to connect to a specific TCP or UDP port on a computer and consequently records the response. A port scanner sends a packet of network data to a port to check the current status. For example, if we wanted to check our web server was operating correctly, we would check the status of port 80 on that server to ensure it was open and listening. The status helps network engineers diagnose network issues or application connectivity issues or helps attackers find possible ports to infiltrate your network.
