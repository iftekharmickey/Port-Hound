# PortScanner #

This script, adorned with an ASCII art banner, serves as a versatile network utility. It allows users to scan a target IP address for open ports within the range of 1 to 65535. Upon execution, the script establishes socket connections to various ports, checking their status. When an open port is encountered, the script reports it as "Port [number] is open."

The tool is invaluable for network administrators and security professionals, aiding in identifying open ports, potential vulnerabilities, and network configuration issues. It leverages Python's socket module and offers a simple yet effective means of assessing the network perimeter.

Please ensure responsible and authorized use of this tool, as unauthorized port scanning can be against the law or violate ethical standards, depending on the context and permissions.
